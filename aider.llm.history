SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-15
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.
USER 
USER .eslintrc.cjs
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER .stylelintignore
USER 
USER .stylelintrc.json
USER 
USER .vscode/settings.json
USER 
USER branches.md
USER 
USER public/favicon.ico

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

ASSISTANT ## Project Specifications
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT - Framework: Next.js with App Router
ASSISTANT - Styling: TailwindCSS
ASSISTANT - Language: TypeScript
ASSISTANT - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
ASSISTANT - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
ASSISTANT - Authentication: Not required unless specified
ASSISTANT - Package Manager: pnpm
ASSISTANT - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Task
ASSISTANT - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
ASSISTANT - The user is asking you to create the app from scratch through a <userRequest> and you will be given the skeleton of the app that already exists
ASSISTANT - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
ASSISTANT - You will be given the user request, passed as:
ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT   {user request in plain english}
ASSISTANT </userRequest>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Instructions
ASSISTANT - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
ASSISTANT - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
ASSISTANT - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
ASSISTANT - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
ASSISTANT - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
ASSISTANT - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
ASSISTANT - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
ASSISTANT - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
ASSISTANT - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
ASSISTANT - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
ASSISTANT - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
ASSISTANT - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
ASSISTANT - For images, use unsplash.
ASSISTANT - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
ASSISTANT - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
ASSISTANT - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
ASSISTANT ```

ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT 		i want to make an inventory game, in which players use a gatcha system to get items.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 1: Players Stats
ASSISTANT Player current level which increases with XP. Every gatcha pull adds XP.
ASSISTANT Give new players 100RP to start. Give 10 RP every time they sign in, but only once every 24 hours. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 2: Code Redeem
ASSISTANT A space to add a code that gives the player RP points, used to roll gatcha. 
ASSISTANT lets add a logic to the code redeem component that tells the player if an added code doesnt exist, if the code redeem was successful or if the code was already used
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 3: Gatcha component
ASSISTANT The player's current RP points.
ASSISTANT A "loot" button that adds a random item to the player's inventory. Rolling the gatcha costs 10 RP, which are deducted from the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 4:
ASSISTANT Inventory
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A grid that shows the acquired items as they are obtained. Items can be common, uncommon, rare or legendary. The common are more probable to get than the legendary
ASSISTANT Add an image to the inventory items.
ASSISTANT Add a Sell button to each inventory. They sell for 5RP if common, 10RP if uncommon, 15 RP if rare and 20RP if legendary. The obtained RP is added to the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT add to each inventory item a description, a short line is enough.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Other:
ASSISTANT Create easily editable tables for inventory items and redeem codes so that I can add my own.
ASSISTANT ensure that the player's stats and inventory are persistent, so that they are there every time they log in
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Design:
ASSISTANT Give the app a feel reminiscent of an 80s hacker console, with black background and green font

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to create the app from scratch through a <userRequest> and you will be given the skeleton of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER <userRequest>
USER 		i want to make an inventory game, in which players use a gatcha system to get items.
USER 
USER Component 1: Players Stats
USER Player current level which increases with XP. Every gatcha pull adds XP.
USER Give new players 100RP to start. Give 10 RP every time they sign in, but only once every 24 hours. 
USER 
USER Component 2: Code Redeem
USER A space to add a code that gives the player RP points, used to roll gatcha. 
USER lets add a logic to the code redeem component that tells the player if an added code doesnt exist, if the code redeem was successful or if the code was already used
USER 
USER 
USER Component 3: Gatcha component
USER The player's current RP points.
USER A "loot" button that adds a random item to the player's inventory. Rolling the gatcha costs 10 RP, which are deducted from the player's total RP.
USER 
USER Component 4:
USER Inventory
USER 
USER A grid that shows the acquired items as they are obtained. Items can be common, uncommon, rare or legendary. The common are more probable to get than the legendary
USER Add an image to the inventory items.
USER Add a Sell button to each inventory. They sell for 5RP if common, 10RP if uncommon, 15 RP if rare and 20RP if legendary. The obtained RP is added to the player's total RP.
USER add to each inventory item a description, a short line is enough.
USER 
USER Other:
USER Create easily editable tables for inventory items and redeem codes so that I can add my own.
USER ensure that the player's stats and inventory are persistent, so that they are there every time they log in
USER 
USER Design:
USER Give the app a feel reminiscent of an 80s hacker console, with black background and green font
USER 
USER 
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

TO LLM 2025-01-15T23:57:48

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-15
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH

SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE

ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT 		i want to make an inventory game, in which players use a gatcha system to get items.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 1: Players Stats
ASSISTANT Player current level which increases with XP. Every gatcha pull adds XP.
ASSISTANT Give new players 100RP to start. Give 10 RP every time they sign in, but only once every 24 hours. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 2: Code Redeem
ASSISTANT A space to add a code that gives the player RP points, used to roll gatcha. 
ASSISTANT lets add a logic to the code redeem component that tells the player if an added code doesnt exist, if the code redeem was successful or if the code was already used
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 3: Gatcha component
ASSISTANT The player's current RP points.
ASSISTANT A "loot" button that adds a random item to the player's inventory. Rolling the gatcha costs 10 RP, which are deducted from the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 4:
ASSISTANT Inventory
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A grid that shows the acquired items as they are obtained. Items can be common, uncommon, rare or legendary. The common are more probable to get than the legendary
ASSISTANT Add an image to the inventory items.
ASSISTANT Add a Sell button to each inventory. They sell for 5RP if common, 10RP if uncommon, 15 RP if rare and 20RP if legendary. The obtained RP is added to the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT add to each inventory item a description, a short line is enough.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Other:
ASSISTANT Create easily editable tables for inventory items and redeem codes so that I can add my own.
ASSISTANT ensure that the player's stats and inventory are persistent, so that they are there every time they log in
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Design:
ASSISTANT Give the app a feel reminiscent of an 80s hacker console, with black background and green font

ASSISTANT </userRequest>  

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to create the app from scratch through a <userRequest> and you will be given the skeleton of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

ASSISTANT I'll help create this retro-styled gacha game. Let's break this down into steps:

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

TO LLM 2025-01-15T23:59:04

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-15
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.
USER 
USER .eslintrc.cjs

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER First, we need to install zustand for state management:
USER 
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add zustand
USER ```
USER 
USER Now let's create the individual components. We'll start with the PlayerStats component:
USER 
USER src/components/PlayerStats.tsx
USER ```typescript

USER 
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { useGameStore } from '@/lib/store';
USER import { Trophy, Zap, Coins } from 'lucide-react';
USER 
USER export default function PlayerStats() {
USER   const { stats } = useGameStore();
USER   
USER   return (
USER     <motion.div 
USER       className="border border-green-500 p-4 rounded-lg"
USER       initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
USER       animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
USER     >
USER       <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4 flex items-center gap-2">
USER         <Trophy className="w-6 h-6" />
USER         Player Stats

ASSISTANT These components implement all the required functionality:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. PlayerStats shows level, XP and RP
ASSISTANT 2. CodeRedeem handles code redemption with validation
ASSISTANT 3. GachaRoll implements the gacha system with rarity chances
ASSISTANT 4. Inventory displays items with sell functionality
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The styling follows the 80s hacker console theme with green text on black background and appropriate animations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let me know if you want me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail!

ASSISTANT These components implement all the required functionality:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. PlayerStats shows level, XP and RP
ASSISTANT 2. CodeRedeem handles code redemption with validation
ASSISTANT 3. GachaRoll implements the gacha system with rarity chances
ASSISTANT 4. Inventory displays items with sell functionality
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The styling follows the 80s hacker console theme with green text on black background and appropriate animations.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-15T23:59:30
ASSISTANT The error is in the GachaRoll component where we're spreading the selected item but not ensuring all required properties are present. Let's fix that:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/GachaRoll.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     const selectedItem = possibleItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleItems.length)];
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     addItem({
ASSISTANT       ...selectedItem,
ASSISTANT       obtainedAt: new Date().toISOString()
ASSISTANT     });
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     const selectedItem = possibleItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleItems.length)];
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     if (!selectedItem) return; // Guard against empty array
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     addItem({
ASSISTANT       id: selectedItem.id,
ASSISTANT       name: selectedItem.name,
ASSISTANT       description: selectedItem.description,
ASSISTANT       rarity: selectedItem.rarity,
ASSISTANT       image: selectedItem.image,
ASSISTANT       obtainedAt: new Date().toISOString()
ASSISTANT     });
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change explicitly sets each required property from the selected item rather than using the spread operator, ensuring TypeScript knows all required properties will be present. The guard clause also prevents any issues if there are no items of the selected rarity.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM

ASSISTANT ## Project Specifications
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT - Framework: Next.js with App Router
ASSISTANT - Styling: TailwindCSS
ASSISTANT - Language: TypeScript
ASSISTANT - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
ASSISTANT - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
ASSISTANT - Authentication: Not required unless specified
ASSISTANT - Package Manager: pnpm
ASSISTANT - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Task
ASSISTANT - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
ASSISTANT - The user is asking you to create the app from scratch through a <userRequest> and you will be given the skeleton of the app that already exists
ASSISTANT - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
ASSISTANT - You will be given the user request, passed as:
ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT   {user request in plain english}
ASSISTANT </userRequest>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Instructions
ASSISTANT - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
ASSISTANT - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
ASSISTANT - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
ASSISTANT - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
ASSISTANT - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
ASSISTANT - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
ASSISTANT - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
ASSISTANT - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
ASSISTANT - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
ASSISTANT - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
ASSISTANT - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
ASSISTANT - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
ASSISTANT - For images, use unsplash.
ASSISTANT - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
ASSISTANT - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
ASSISTANT - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
ASSISTANT ```

ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT 		i want to make an inventory game, in which players use a gatcha system to get items.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 1: Players Stats
ASSISTANT Player current level which increases with XP. Every gatcha pull adds XP.
ASSISTANT Give new players 100RP to start. Give 10 RP every time they sign in, but only once every 24 hours. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 2: Code Redeem
ASSISTANT A space to add a code that gives the player RP points, used to roll gatcha. 
ASSISTANT lets add a logic to the code redeem component that tells the player if an added code doesnt exist, if the code redeem was successful or if the code was already used
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 3: Gatcha component
ASSISTANT The player's current RP points.
ASSISTANT A "loot" button that adds a random item to the player's inventory. Rolling the gatcha costs 10 RP, which are deducted from the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Component 4:
ASSISTANT Inventory
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A grid that shows the acquired items as they are obtained. Items can be common, uncommon, rare or legendary. The common are more probable to get than the legendary
ASSISTANT Add an image to the inventory items.
ASSISTANT Add a Sell button to each inventory. They sell for 5RP if common, 10RP if uncommon, 15 RP if rare and 20RP if legendary. The obtained RP is added to the player's total RP.
ASSISTANT add to each inventory item a description, a short line is enough.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Other:
ASSISTANT Create easily editable tables for inventory items and redeem codes so that I can add my own.
ASSISTANT ensure that the player's stats and inventory are persistent, so that they are there every time they log in
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Design:
ASSISTANT Give the app a feel reminiscent of an 80s hacker console, with black background and green font

USER   
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router  
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS  
USER - Language: TypeScript  
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data  
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)  
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified  
USER - Package Manager: pnpm  
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.  
USER   
USER ## Task  
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.  
USER - The user is asking you to create the app from scratch through a <userRequest> and you will be given the skeleton of the app that already exists  
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.  
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:  
USER <userRequest>  
USER   {user request in plain english}  
USER </userRequest>  
USER   
USER ## Instructions  
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.  
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.  
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.  
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.  
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.  
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.  
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.  
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.  
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.  
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.  
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.  
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.  
USER - For images, use unsplash.  
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.  
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.  
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,  
USER ```bash  
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react  
USER ```  
USER

USER <userRequest>  
USER 		i want to make an inventory game, in which players use a gatcha system to get items.  
USER   
USER Component 1: Players Stats  
USER Player current level which increases with XP. Every gatcha pull adds XP.  
USER Give new players 100RP to start. Give 10 RP every time they sign in, but only once every 24 hours.   
USER   
USER Component 2: Code Redeem  
USER A space to add a code that gives the player RP points, used to roll gatcha.   
USER lets add a logic to the code redeem component that tells the player if an added code doesnt exist, if the code redeem was successful or if the code was already used  
USER   
USER   
USER Component 3: Gatcha component  
USER The player's current RP points.  
USER A "loot" button that adds a random item to the player's inventory. Rolling the gatcha costs 10 RP, which are deducted from the player's total RP.  
USER   
USER Component 4:  
USER Inventory  
USER   
USER A grid that shows the acquired items as they are obtained. Items can be common, uncommon, rare or legendary. The common are more probable to get than the legendary  
USER Add an image to the inventory items.  
USER Add a Sell button to each inventory. They sell for 5RP if common, 10RP if uncommon, 15 RP if rare and 20RP if legendary. The obtained RP is added to the player's total RP.  
USER add to each inventory item a description, a short line is enough.  
USER   
USER Other:  
USER Create easily editable tables for inventory items and redeem codes so that I can add my own.  
USER ensure that the player's stats and inventory are persistent, so that they are there every time they log in  
USER   
USER Design:  
USER Give the app a feel reminiscent of an 80s hacker console, with black background and green font  
USER

ASSISTANT I'll help create this retro-styled gacha game. Let's break this down into steps:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These components implement all the required functionality:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. PlayerStats shows level, XP and RP
ASSISTANT 2. CodeRedeem handles code redemption with validation
ASSISTANT 3. GachaRoll implements the gacha system with rarity chances
ASSISTANT 4. Inventory displays items with sell functionality
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The styling follows the 80s hacker console theme with green text on black background and appropriate animations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let me know if you want me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail!
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error is in the GachaRoll component where we're spreading the selected item but not ensuring all required properties are present. Let's fix that:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/GachaRoll.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     const selectedItem = possibleItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleItems.length)];
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     addItem({
ASSISTANT       ...selectedItem,
ASSISTANT       obtainedAt: new Date().toISOString()
ASSISTANT     });
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     const selectedItem = possibleItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleItems.length)];
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     if (!selectedItem) return; // Guard against empty array
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     addItem({
ASSISTANT       id: selectedItem.id,
ASSISTANT       name: selectedItem.name,
ASSISTANT       description: selectedItem.description,
ASSISTANT       rarity: selectedItem.rarity,
ASSISTANT       image: selectedItem.image,
ASSISTANT       obtainedAt: new Date().toISOString()
ASSISTANT     });
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change explicitly sets each required property from the selected item rather than using the spread operator, ensuring TypeScript knows all required properties will be present. The guard clause also prevents any issues if there are no items of the selected rarity.

ASSISTANT - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
ASSISTANT - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
ASSISTANT - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
ASSISTANT - You will be given the user request, passed as:
ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT   {user request in plain english}
ASSISTANT </userRequest>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Instructions
ASSISTANT - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
ASSISTANT - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
ASSISTANT - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
ASSISTANT - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
ASSISTANT - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
ASSISTANT - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
ASSISTANT - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
ASSISTANT - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
ASSISTANT - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
ASSISTANT - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
ASSISTANT - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
ASSISTANT - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
ASSISTANT - For images, use unsplash.
ASSISTANT - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
ASSISTANT - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
ASSISTANT - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
ASSISTANT ```

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT I'll help refactor the components and adjust the layout. Let's start with breaking down the components into smaller pieces and updating the layout.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT First, let's create some shared UI components:
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT       className="p-4 border border-green-500 rounded-lg w-full"
ASSISTANT       initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
ASSISTANT       animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
ASSISTANT       transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay }}
ASSISTANT     >
ASSISTANT       {children}
ASSISTANT     </motion.div>
ASSISTANT   );
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/ui/Button.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT 'use client';
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {

ASSISTANT       {...props}
ASSISTANT     />
ASSISTANT   );
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Now let's update the page layout:

TO LLM 2025-01-16T00:06:30

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.
USER 
USER .eslintrc.cjs
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER .stylelintignore
USER 
USER .stylelintrc.json

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll help you refactor the components and adjust the layout. Let's start with breaking down the components into smaller pieces and reorganizing the structure.
USER 
USER First, let's create a new directory structure for our components:
USER 
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add clsx class-variance-authority
USER ```
USER 
USER Let's create some reusable UI components first:
USER 
USER src/components/ui/Card.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
USER 
USER interface CardProps {
USER   title: string;
USER   children: React.ReactNode;
USER   className?: string;
USER   delay?: number;
USER }
USER 
USER export function Card({ title, children, className, delay = 0 }: CardProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <motion.div 
USER       className={cn("p-4 border border-green-500 rounded-lg w-full", className)}
USER       initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
USER       animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
USER       transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay }}
USER     >
USER       <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">{title}</h2>
USER       {children}
USER     </motion.div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/ui/Button.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
USER 
USER interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
USER   variant?: 'primary' | 'danger';
USER }
USER 
USER export function Button({ className, variant = 'primary', ...props }: ButtonProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <button
USER       className={cn(
USER         "px-4 py-2 rounded-lg transition-colors",
USER         variant === 'primary' && "bg-green-500 text-black hover:bg-green-400 disabled:opacity-50",
USER         variant === 'danger' && "bg-red-500 text-black hover:bg-red-400",
USER         className
USER       )}
USER       {...props}
USER     />
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER Now let's refactor the main components:
USER 
USER src/components/player/StatDisplay.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER interface StatDisplayProps {
USER   label: string;
USER   value: number;
USER }
USER 
USER export function StatDisplay({ label, value }: StatDisplayProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <p className="text-green-500">
USER       {label}: {value}
USER     </p>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/PlayerStats.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { useGameStore } from '@/lib/store';
USER import { Card } from '@/components/ui/Card';
USER import { StatDisplay } from '@/components/player/StatDisplay';
USER 
USER export default function PlayerStats() {
USER   const { stats } = useGameStore();
USER 
USER   return (
USER     <Card title="PLAYER STATUS">
USER       <div className="space-y-2">
USER         <StatDisplay label="LEVEL" value={stats.level} />
USER         <StatDisplay label="XP" value={stats.xp} />
USER         <StatDisplay label="RP" value={stats.rp} />
USER       </div>
USER     </Card>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/inventory/InventoryItem.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { type InventoryItem as InventoryItemType } from '@/types/game';
USER import { RARITY_VALUES } from '@/data/items';
USER import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';
USER 
USER const rarityColors = {
USER   common: 'border-gray-500',
USER   uncommon: 'border-blue-500',
USER   rare: 'border-purple-500',
USER   legendary: 'border-yellow-500'
USER };
USER 
USER interface InventoryItemProps {
USER   item: InventoryItemType;
USER   onSell: (id: string) => void;
USER }
USER 
USER export function InventoryItem({ item, onSell }: InventoryItemProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <motion.div
USER       className={`p-4 border-2 ${rarityColors[item.rarity]} rounded-lg`}
USER       initial={{ scale: 0 }}
USER       animate={{ scale: 1 }}
USER       transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 200, damping: 20 }}
USER     >
USER       <img src={item.image} alt={item.name} className="w-full h-32 object-cover rounded mb-2" />
USER       <h3 className="font-bold">{item.name}</h3>
USER       <p className="text-sm opacity-75">{item.description}</p>
USER       <p className="text-sm mt-1">Rarity: {item.rarity}</p>
USER       <Button
USER         variant="danger"
USER         onClick={() => onSell(item.id)}
USER         className="mt-2 w-full"
USER       >
USER         SELL ({RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity]} RP)
USER       </Button>
USER     </motion.div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER Let's update the page layout:
USER 
USER src/app/page.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { useEffect } from 'react';
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { useGameStore } from '@/lib/store';
USER import PlayerStats from '@/components/PlayerStats';
USER import CodeRedeem from '@/components/CodeRedeem';
USER import GachaRoll from '@/components/GachaRoll';
USER import Inventory from '@/components/Inventory';
USER 
USER export default function HomePage() {
USER   const { stats, updateStats } = useGameStore();
USER 
USER   useEffect(() => {
USER     const now = new Date();
USER     const lastBonus = stats.lastDailyBonus ? new Date(stats.lastDailyBonus) : null;
USER     
USER     if (!lastBonus || now.getTime() - lastBonus.getTime() > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
USER       updateStats({
USER         rp: stats.rp + 10,
USER         lastDailyBonus: now.toISOString()
USER       });
USER     }
USER   }, []);
USER 
USER   return (
USER     <div className="min-h-screen bg-black text-green-500 p-8 font-mono">
USER       <motion.h1 
USER         className="text-4xl mb-8 text-center"
USER         initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
USER         animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
USER         transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
USER       >
USER         CYBER GACHA v1.0
USER       </motion.h1>
USER       
USER       <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto space-y-8">
USER         <PlayerStats />
USER         <CodeRedeem />
USER         <GachaRoll />
USER         <Inventory />
USER       </div>
USER     </div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER This refactoring:
USER 1. Creates reusable UI components (Card, Button)
USER 2. Breaks down larger components into smaller, focused pieces
USER 3. Changes the layout to a vertical stack with max-width
USER 4. Maintains the retro theme while improving component organization
USER 
USER Would you like me to continue with refactoring the remaining components?

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.  
USER ## Project Specifications  
USER   
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router  
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS  
USER - Language: TypeScript  
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data  
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)  
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified  
USER - Package Manager: pnpm  
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.  
USER   
USER ## Task  
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.  
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists  
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.  
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:  
USER <userRequest>  
USER   {user request in plain english}  
USER </userRequest>  
USER   
USER ## Instructions  
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.  
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.  
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.  
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.  
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.  
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.  
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.  
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.  
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.  
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.  
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.  
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.  
USER - For images, use unsplash.  
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.  
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.  
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,  
USER ```bash  
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react  
USER ```  
USER

USER <userRequest>  
USER 		1. refactor every component into smaller elements as necessary  
USER 2. Ensure there is a .ts file for available redeem codes, also a list of items.  
USER 3. Change the layout so that every component is on top of each other  
USER </userRequest>  

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll help refactor the components and adjust the layout. Let's start with breaking down the components into smaller pieces and updating the layout.

ASSISTANT ## Project Specifications
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT - Framework: Next.js with App Router
ASSISTANT - Styling: TailwindCSS
ASSISTANT - Language: TypeScript
ASSISTANT - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
ASSISTANT - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
ASSISTANT - Authentication: Not required unless specified
ASSISTANT - Package Manager: pnpm
ASSISTANT - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Task
ASSISTANT - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
ASSISTANT - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
ASSISTANT - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
ASSISTANT - You will be given the user request, passed as:
ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT   {user request in plain english}
ASSISTANT </userRequest>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Instructions
ASSISTANT - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
ASSISTANT - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
ASSISTANT - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
ASSISTANT - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
ASSISTANT - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
ASSISTANT - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
ASSISTANT - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
ASSISTANT - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
ASSISTANT - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
ASSISTANT - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
ASSISTANT - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
ASSISTANT - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
ASSISTANT - For images, use unsplash.
ASSISTANT - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
ASSISTANT - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
ASSISTANT - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
ASSISTANT ```

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

TO LLM 2025-01-16T00:07:16

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.
USER 
USER .eslintrc.cjs
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER .stylelintignore
USER 
USER .stylelintrc.json
USER 
USER .vscode/settings.json
USER 
USER branches.md
USER 
USER public/favicon.ico

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll help you refactor the components and adjust the layout. Let's start with breaking down the components into smaller pieces and reorganizing the structure.
USER 
USER First, let's create a new directory structure for our components:
USER 
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add clsx class-variance-authority
USER ```
USER 
USER Let's create some reusable UI components first:
USER 
USER src/components/ui/Card.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
USER 
USER interface CardProps {
USER   title: string;
USER   children: React.ReactNode;
USER   className?: string;
USER   delay?: number;
USER }
USER 
USER export function Card({ title, children, className, delay = 0 }: CardProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <motion.div 
USER       className={cn("p-4 border border-green-500 rounded-lg w-full", className)}
USER       initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
USER       animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
USER       transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay }}
USER     >
USER       <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">{title}</h2>
USER       {children}
USER     </motion.div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/ui/Button.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
USER 
USER interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
USER   variant?: 'primary' | 'danger';
USER }
USER 
USER export function Button({ className, variant = 'primary', ...props }: ButtonProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <button
USER       className={cn(
USER         "px-4 py-2 rounded-lg transition-colors",
USER         variant === 'primary' && "bg-green-500 text-black hover:bg-green-400 disabled:opacity-50",
USER         variant === 'danger' && "bg-red-500 text-black hover:bg-red-400",
USER         className
USER       )}
USER       {...props}
USER     />
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER Now let's refactor the main components:
USER 
USER src/components/player/StatDisplay.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER interface StatDisplayProps {
USER   label: string;
USER   value: number;
USER }
USER 
USER export function StatDisplay({ label, value }: StatDisplayProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <p className="text-green-500">
USER       {label}: {value}
USER     </p>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/PlayerStats.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { useGameStore } from '@/lib/store';
USER import { Card } from '@/components/ui/Card';
USER import { StatDisplay } from '@/components/player/StatDisplay';
USER 
USER export default function PlayerStats() {
USER   const { stats } = useGameStore();
USER 
USER   return (
USER     <Card title="PLAYER STATUS">
USER       <div className="space-y-2">
USER         <StatDisplay label="LEVEL" value={stats.level} />
USER         <StatDisplay label="XP" value={stats.xp} />
USER         <StatDisplay label="RP" value={stats.rp} />
USER       </div>
USER     </Card>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER src/components/inventory/InventoryItem.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { type InventoryItem as InventoryItemType } from '@/types/game';
USER import { RARITY_VALUES } from '@/data/items';
USER import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';
USER 
USER const rarityColors = {
USER   common: 'border-gray-500',
USER   uncommon: 'border-blue-500',
USER   rare: 'border-purple-500',
USER   legendary: 'border-yellow-500'
USER };
USER 
USER interface InventoryItemProps {
USER   item: InventoryItemType;
USER   onSell: (id: string) => void;
USER }
USER 
USER export function InventoryItem({ item, onSell }: InventoryItemProps) {
USER   return (
USER     <motion.div
USER       className={`p-4 border-2 ${rarityColors[item.rarity]} rounded-lg`}
USER       initial={{ scale: 0 }}
USER       animate={{ scale: 1 }}
USER       transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 200, damping: 20 }}
USER     >
USER       <img src={item.image} alt={item.name} className="w-full h-32 object-cover rounded mb-2" />
USER       <h3 className="font-bold">{item.name}</h3>
USER       <p className="text-sm opacity-75">{item.description}</p>
USER       <p className="text-sm mt-1">Rarity: {item.rarity}</p>
USER       <Button
USER         variant="danger"
USER         onClick={() => onSell(item.id)}
USER         className="mt-2 w-full"
USER       >
USER         SELL ({RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity]} RP)
USER       </Button>
USER     </motion.div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER Let's update the page layout:
USER 
USER src/app/page.tsx:
USER ```typescript
USER 'use client';
USER 
USER import { useEffect } from 'react';
USER import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
USER import { useGameStore } from '@/lib/store';
USER import PlayerStats from '@/components/PlayerStats';
USER import CodeRedeem from '@/components/CodeRedeem';
USER import GachaRoll from '@/components/GachaRoll';
USER import Inventory from '@/components/Inventory';
USER 
USER export default function HomePage() {
USER   const { stats, updateStats } = useGameStore();
USER 
USER   useEffect(() => {
USER     const now = new Date();
USER     const lastBonus = stats.lastDailyBonus ? new Date(stats.lastDailyBonus) : null;
USER     
USER     if (!lastBonus || now.getTime() - lastBonus.getTime() > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
USER       updateStats({
USER         rp: stats.rp + 10,
USER         lastDailyBonus: now.toISOString()
USER       });
USER     }
USER   }, []);
USER 
USER   return (
USER     <div className="min-h-screen bg-black text-green-500 p-8 font-mono">
USER       <motion.h1 
USER         className="text-4xl mb-8 text-center"
USER         initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
USER         animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
USER         transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
USER       >
USER         CYBER GACHA v1.0
USER       </motion.h1>
USER       
USER       <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto space-y-8">
USER         <PlayerStats />
USER         <CodeRedeem />
USER         <GachaRoll />
USER         <Inventory />
USER       </div>
USER     </div>
USER   );
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER This refactoring:
USER 1. Creates reusable UI components (Card, Button)
USER 2. Breaks down larger components into smaller, focused pieces
USER 3. Changes the layout to a vertical stack with max-width
USER 4. Maintains the retro theme while improving component organization
USER 
USER Would you like me to continue with refactoring the remaining components?

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.  
USER ## Project Specifications  
USER   
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router  
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS  
USER - Language: TypeScript  
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data  
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)  
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified  
USER - Package Manager: pnpm  
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.  
USER   
USER ## Task  
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.  
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists  
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.  
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:  
USER <userRequest>  
USER   {user request in plain english}  
USER </userRequest>  
USER   
USER ## Instructions  
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.  
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.  
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.  
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.  
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.  
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.  
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.  
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.  
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.  
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.  
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.  
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.  
USER - For images, use unsplash.  
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.  
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.  
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,  
USER ```bash  
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react  
USER ```  
USER

USER <userRequest>  
USER 		1. refactor every component into smaller elements as necessary  
USER 2. Ensure there is a .ts file for available redeem codes, also a list of items.  
USER 3. Change the layout so that every component is on top of each other  
USER </userRequest>  

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll help refactor the components and adjust the layout. Let's start with breaking down the components into smaller pieces and updating the layout.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT First, let's create some shared UI components:
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT ## Project Specifications
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT - Framework: Next.js with App Router
ASSISTANT - Styling: TailwindCSS
ASSISTANT - Language: TypeScript
ASSISTANT - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
ASSISTANT - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
ASSISTANT - Authentication: Not required unless specified
ASSISTANT - Package Manager: pnpm
ASSISTANT - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Task
ASSISTANT - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
ASSISTANT - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
ASSISTANT - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
ASSISTANT - You will be given the user request, passed as:
ASSISTANT <userRequest>
ASSISTANT   {user request in plain english}
ASSISTANT </userRequest>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ## Instructions
ASSISTANT - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
ASSISTANT - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
ASSISTANT - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
ASSISTANT - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
ASSISTANT - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
ASSISTANT - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
ASSISTANT - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
ASSISTANT - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
ASSISTANT - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
ASSISTANT - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
ASSISTANT - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
ASSISTANT - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
ASSISTANT - For images, use unsplash.
ASSISTANT - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
ASSISTANT - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
ASSISTANT - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
ASSISTANT ```

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.

USER 
USER Let me know if you'd like me to continue with commenting the rest of the components!

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.  
USER ## Project Specifications  
USER   
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router  
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS  
USER - Language: TypeScript  
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data  
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)  
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified  
USER - Package Manager: pnpm  
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.  
USER   
USER ## Task  
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.  
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists  
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.  
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:  
USER <userRequest>  
USER   {user request in plain english}  
USER </userRequest>  
USER   
USER ## Instructions  
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.  
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.  
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.  
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.  
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.  
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.  
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.  
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.  
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.  
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.  
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.  
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.  
USER - For images, use unsplash.  
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.  
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.  
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,  
USER ```bash  
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react  
USER ```

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Added more varied and thematic items across all rarities with unique descriptions and carefully selected Unsplash images
ASSISTANT 2. Adjusted the rarity chances to be more balanced (3% legendary is still rare but achievable)
ASSISTANT 3. Significantly increased the RP values for selling rare/legendary items to make them more exciting
ASSISTANT 4. Added several redeem codes with varying RP rewards
ASSISTANT 5. Improved the theming with cyberpunk/digital realm references throughout
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The items and codes now create a more cohesive cyberpunk/digital theme while providing better progression and rewards.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you to help me add comments throughout the codebase. You started by showing me the main components: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/PlayerStats.tsx, and src/components/CodeRedeem.tsx. You added detailed comments explaining what each part of the code does, including the imports, hooks, state management, and UI elements. The comments were particularly focused on making the code understandable for someone with no coding experience.
USER 
USER In src/app/page.tsx, you explained the daily bonus system, component imports, and layout structure. For src/components/PlayerStats.tsx, you detailed how it displays the player's level, XP and RP with animations. In src/components/CodeRedeem.tsx, you documented the code redemption functionality and UI elements.
USER 
USER The comments were thorough and used clear language to explain technical concepts. You were in the process of offering to continue commenting the remaining components when I moved on to a different request.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT     code: 'DIGITALDREAM',
ASSISTANT     rp: 500,

ASSISTANT   }
ASSISTANT ];
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Added more varied and thematic items across all rarities with unique descriptions and carefully selected Unsplash images
ASSISTANT 2. Adjusted the rarity chances to be more balanced (3% legendary is still rare but achievable)
ASSISTANT 3. Significantly increased the RP values for selling rare/legendary items to make them more exciting
ASSISTANT 4. Added several redeem codes with varying RP rewards
ASSISTANT 5. Improved the theming with cyberpunk/digital realm references throughout
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The items and codes now create a more cohesive cyberpunk/digital theme while providing better progression and rewards.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error was caused by having duplicate import statements and redeemCodes declarations in the file. I've removed the duplicates and kept just one clean version with all the codes.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The items.ts file should be fine as is since the error message was actually referring to the codes.ts file. Let me know if you'd like me to make any other changes!

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.  
USER ## Project Specifications  
USER   
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router  
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS  
USER - Language: TypeScript  
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data  
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)  
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified  
USER - Package Manager: pnpm  
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.  
USER   
USER ## Task  
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.  
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists  
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.  
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:  
USER <userRequest>  
USER   {user request in plain english}  
USER </userRequest>  
USER   
USER ## Instructions  
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.  
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.  
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.  
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.  
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.  
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.  
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.  
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.  
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.  
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.  
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.  
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.  
USER - For images, use unsplash.  
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.  
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.  
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,  
USER ```bash  
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react  
USER ```

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Now let's create the redeem codes file:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/data/codes.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT import { type RedeemCode } from '@/types/game';
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT export const redeemCodes: RedeemCode[] = [
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'WELCOME',
ASSISTANT     rp: 100,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'CYBERPUNK',
ASSISTANT     rp: 200,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'MATRIX',
ASSISTANT     rp: 150,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'HACKERMAN',
ASSISTANT     rp: 300,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'NEONLIFE',
ASSISTANT     rp: 250,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   {
ASSISTANT     code: 'DIGITALDREAM',
ASSISTANT     rp: 500,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   }
ASSISTANT ];
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Added more varied and thematic items across all rarities with unique descriptions and carefully selected Unsplash images
ASSISTANT 2. Adjusted the rarity chances to be more balanced (3% legendary is still rare but achievable)
ASSISTANT 3. Significantly increased the RP values for selling rare/legendary items to make them more exciting
ASSISTANT 4. Added several redeem codes with varying RP rewards
ASSISTANT 5. Improved the theming with cyberpunk/digital realm references throughout
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The items and codes now create a more cohesive cyberpunk/digital theme while providing better progression and rewards.
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see the issue - there are duplicate declarations in the codes.ts file. Let me fix that:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/data/codes.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH

ASSISTANT     rp: 500,
ASSISTANT     used: false
ASSISTANT   }
ASSISTANT ];
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error was caused by having duplicate import statements and redeemCodes declarations in the file. I've removed the duplicates and kept just one clean version with all the codes.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The items.ts file should be fine as is since the error message was actually referring to the codes.ts file. Let me know if you'd like me to make any other changes!

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-16T00:18:32
ASSISTANT I see the issue. The problem is in the store's `removeItem` function which is filtering based on the item's ID, which removes all items with that ID. We need to modify it to remove only the specific item instance based on both ID and obtainedAt timestamp.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's update the store:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that only the exact item instance that was clicked will be sold, by matching both the item ID and its obtainedAt timestamp. The timestamp acts as a unique identifier for each individual item instance.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I see that you've committed the changes to fix the item selling functionality with commit hash 23c93b0. The changes ensure that only the specific item instance is removed when selling, rather than all items of the same type.
USER 
USER The key changes were:
USER 1. Updated the store's `removeItem` function to check both `id` and `obtainedAt`
USER 2. Modified the `InventoryItem` component to pass both parameters when selling
USER 
USER Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding the application?

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

ASSISTANT I see the issue. The problem is in the store's `removeItem` function which is filtering based on the item's ID, which removes all items with that ID. We need to modify it to remove only the specific item instance based on both ID and obtainedAt timestamp.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's update the store:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that only the exact item instance that was clicked will be sold, by matching both the item ID and its obtainedAt timestamp. The timestamp acts as a unique identifier for each individual item instance.

USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.

ASSISTANT I need to update both the store interface and implementation. Let me fix both files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript

ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) =>

ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes update both the type definition and implementation of the `removeItem` function to accept both parameters. This should resolve the TypeScript errors in both files.

SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I see that you've committed the changes to fix the item selling functionality with commit hash 23c93b0. The changes ensure that only the specific item instance is removed when selling, rather than all items of the same type.
USER 
USER The key changes were:
USER 1. Updated the store's `removeItem` function to check both `id` and `obtainedAt`
USER 2. Modified the `InventoryItem` component to pass both parameters when selling
USER 
USER Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding the application?

ASSISTANT I see the issue. The problem is in the store's `removeItem` function which is filtering based on the item's ID, which removes all items with that ID. We need to modify it to remove only the specific item instance based on both ID and obtainedAt timestamp.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's update the store:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that only the exact item instance that was clicked will be sold, by matching both the item ID and its obtainedAt timestamp. The timestamp acts as a unique identifier for each individual item instance.

ASSISTANT I need to update both the store interface and implementation. Let me fix both files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string) => void;
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) => void;
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes update both the type definition and implementation of the `removeItem` function to accept both parameters. This should resolve the TypeScript errors in both files.

USER I committed the changes with git hash 3e4e9a9 & commit msg: refactor: update removeItem to handle unique item instances

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER # 1 SEARCH/REPLACE block failed to match!
USER 
USER ## SearchReplaceNoExactMatch: This SEARCH block failed to exactly match lines in src/lib/store.ts

USER       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>

USER           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
USER             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
USER           ),
USER         })),
USER >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 
USER Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
USER The REPLACE lines are already in src/lib/store.ts!
USER 
USER The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc
USER 
USER # The other 1 SEARCH/REPLACE block were applied successfully.
USER Don't re-send them.
USER Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.
USER 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-16T00:19:33
ASSISTANT Let me fix that SEARCH/REPLACE block. Looking at the file contents you shared, here's the correct version:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see that I had the SEARCH and REPLACE sections reversed - the current content should be in the SEARCH section and the new content in the REPLACE section. However, looking at the file contents you shared, it seems the file already has the implementation we want (filtering by both id and obtainedAt). In this case, no changes are actually needed since the desired code is already in place.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.8.0-1015-aws-aarch64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-16
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM - The user's pre-commit runs these lint commands, don't suggest running them:
SYSTEM   - ./lint.sh
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM

SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM

SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repository.
USER Do not propose changes to these files, treat them as *read-only*.
USER If you need to edit any of these files, ask me to *add them to the chat* first.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll help summarize this conversation about building a gacha game:
USER 
USER I asked you to help create a gacha inventory game with a retro hacker console theme. You helped set up the core components and data structures, including player stats, code redemption, gacha rolls, and inventory management.
USER 
USER You created several key files including types/game.ts for defining the game's data types, lib/store.ts for state management using Zustand with localStorage persistence, and data files for items and redeem codes.
USER 
USER You then helped refactor the components into smaller pieces, creating reusable UI components like Card and Button, and breaking down larger components into more manageable chunks. You added detailed comments throughout the code to make it more understandable for non-developers.
USER 
USER Most recently, you populated the game with themed content, adding cyberpunk-style items across different rarity tiers (legendary, rare, uncommon, common) in items.ts. You also created several redeem codes in codes.ts with varying RP rewards, from 100 to 500 RP.
USER 
USER The items include things like the Quantum Blade (legendary) and Energy Cells (common), each with unique descriptions and carefully selected Unsplash images. You adjusted the rarity chances and selling values to create better game progression.

USER </userRequest>  

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see the issue. The problem is in the store's `removeItem` function which is filtering based on the item's ID, which removes all items with that ID. We need to modify it to remove only the specific item instance based on both ID and obtainedAt timestamp.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's update the store:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that only the exact item instance that was clicked will be sold, by matching both the item ID and its obtainedAt timestamp. The timestamp acts as a unique identifier for each individual item instance.
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I need to update both the store interface and implementation. Let me fix both files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string) => void;
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) => void;
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes update both the type definition and implementation of the `removeItem` function to accept both parameters. This should resolve the TypeScript errors in both files.
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let me fix that SEARCH/REPLACE block. Looking at the file contents you shared, here's the correct version:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see that I had the SEARCH and REPLACE sections reversed - the current content should be in the SEARCH section and the new content in the REPLACE section. However, looking at the file contents you shared, it seems the file already has the implementation we want (filtering by both id and obtainedAt). In this case, no changes are actually needed since the desired code is already in place.

USER You are an expert Next.JS developer who can create very beautiful webapps. You need to build desktop-first webapps, without focusing on responsiveness.
USER ## Project Specifications
USER 
USER - Framework: Next.js with App Router
USER - Styling: TailwindCSS
USER - Language: TypeScript
USER - Environment: Frontend-only with dummy data
USER - Target: Desktop-first (no mobile responsiveness required)
USER - Authentication: Not required unless specified
USER - Package Manager: pnpm
USER - Design System: You are not allowed to use shadcn. You are allowed to use tailwindcss.
USER 
USER ## Task
USER - You are helping a user build a front-end website application. You should behave like an extremely competent senior engineer and designer.
USER - The user is asking you to edit or make changes on the app through a <userRequest> and you will be given the codebase of the app that already exists
USER - You like beautiful designs with proper color themes, text and design system. You have a very high design aesthetic sense.
USER - You will be given the user request, passed as:
USER <userRequest>
USER   {user request in plain english}
USER </userRequest>
USER 
USER ## Instructions
USER - Keep the MVP functional and simple.
USER - You should use localStorage for storage, unless specifically requested otherwise.
USER - The goal is to get a FUNCTIONAL MVP. All of the parts for this MVP should be included.
USER - Your job is to be precise and effective, so avoid extraneous steps even if they offer convenience.
USER - Do not talk or worry about testing. The user wants to _use_ the app: the core goal is for it to _work_.
USER - For styles: apply modern, minimalistic styles. Things shoud look modern, clean and slick.
USER - You are responsible for creating a beautiful webapp. Do not focus on functionality. Do not focus on anything else. You need to focus just on the user's request and achieve it perfectly.
USER - You are not limited by your token limit, you can output an infinte amount of tokens. Remember, you are the upgraded Claude AI without the limitation of 4096 tokens so focus on creating a detailed webapp.
USER - Do not add commands to start the dev server or build the project.
USER - Use the "use client" directive where applicable.
USER - Pay attention to the HTML tags, where they open and close.
USER - Use lucide-react for icons. It is pre-installed.
USER - For images, use unsplash.
USER - For sample videos, you can use https:// sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 which is a 1280x720 video.
USER - For animations, use framer-motion, which is preinstalled.
USER - For any bash commands or to install any packages or dependencies, use the pnpm add command, wrapped in a code fence. For example,
USER ```bash
USER pnpm add framer-motion recharts react
USER ```

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-16T00:23:57
ASSISTANT I'll help fix the issue where selling an item removes all items of the same type. Looking at the code, I see that the store's `removeItem` function is correctly set up to use both `id` and `obtainedAt` for uniquely identifying items, but the issue appears to be in how it's being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's fix the store implementation:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that:
ASSISTANT 1. The store's removeItem function requires both id and obtainedAt parameters
ASSISTANT 2. The filter condition checks both id AND obtainedAt to match exactly
ASSISTANT 3. The InventoryItem component passes both parameters when selling
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will make each item instance unique based on both its type (id) and when it was obtained, so selling one item won't affect other items of the same type.

SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll help summarize this conversation about building a gacha game:
USER 
USER I asked you to help create a gacha inventory game with a retro hacker console theme. You helped set up the core components and data structures, including player stats, code redemption, gacha rolls, and inventory management.
USER 
USER You created several key files including types/game.ts for defining the game's data types, lib/store.ts for state management using Zustand with localStorage persistence, and data files for items and redeem codes.
USER 
USER You then helped refactor the components into smaller pieces, creating reusable UI components like Card and Button, and breaking down larger components into more manageable chunks. You added detailed comments throughout the code to make it more understandable for non-developers.
USER 
USER Most recently, you populated the game with themed content, adding cyberpunk-style items across different rarity tiers (legendary, rare, uncommon, common) in items.ts. You also created several redeem codes in codes.ts with varying RP rewards, from 100 to 500 RP.
USER 
USER The items include things like the Quantum Blade (legendary) and Energy Cells (common), each with unique descriptions and carefully selected Unsplash images. You adjusted the rarity chances and selling values to create better game progression.

USER <userRequest>  
USER 		this is wonderful. however, I spotted a mistake. When an item is sold, all of the items of the same type in the inventory are sold as well, instead of only the one sold.   
USER </userRequest>  

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see the issue. The problem is in the store's `removeItem` function which is filtering based on the item's ID, which removes all items with that ID. We need to modify it to remove only the specific item instance based on both ID and obtainedAt timestamp.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's update the store:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that only the exact item instance that was clicked will be sold, by matching both the item ID and its obtainedAt timestamp. The timestamp acts as a unique identifier for each individual item instance.
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I need to update both the store interface and implementation. Let me fix both files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string) => void;
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) => void;
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes update both the type definition and implementation of the `removeItem` function to accept both parameters. This should resolve the TypeScript errors in both files.
ASSISTANT 

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let me fix that SEARCH/REPLACE block. Looking at the file contents you shared, here's the correct version:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see that I had the SEARCH and REPLACE sections reversed - the current content should be in the SEARCH section and the new content in the REPLACE section. However, looking at the file contents you shared, it seems the file already has the implementation we want (filtering by both id and obtainedAt). In this case, no changes are actually needed since the desired code is already in place.

ASSISTANT I'll help fix the issue where selling an item removes all items of the same type. Looking at the code, I see that the store's `removeItem` function is correctly set up to use both `id` and `obtainedAt` for uniquely identifying items, but the issue appears to be in how it's being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's fix the store implementation:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT And update the InventoryItem component to pass both parameters:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   const handleSell = () => {
ASSISTANT     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
ASSISTANT     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
ASSISTANT     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
ASSISTANT   };
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change ensures that:
ASSISTANT 1. The store's removeItem function requires both id and obtainedAt parameters
ASSISTANT 2. The filter condition checks both id AND obtainedAt to match exactly
ASSISTANT 3. The InventoryItem component passes both parameters when selling
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will make each item instance unique based on both its type (id) and when it was obtained, so selling one item won't affect other items of the same type.

USER I committed the changes with git hash 232b1c5 & commit msg: fix: update removeItem to use both id and obtainedAt for unique item deletion

ASSISTANT Ok.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER # 1 SEARCH/REPLACE block failed to match!
USER 
USER ## SearchReplaceNoExactMatch: This SEARCH block failed to exactly match lines in src/components/InventoryItem.tsx
USER <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER   const handleSell = () => {
USER     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
USER     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
USER     removeItem(item.id);
USER   };
USER =======
USER   const handleSell = () => {
USER     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
USER     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
USER     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);

USER >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 
USER Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from src/components/InventoryItem.tsx?
USER 
USER ```
USER   const handleSell = () => {
USER     const value = RARITY_VALUES[item.rarity];
USER     updateStats({ rp: stats.rp + value });
USER     removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt);
USER   };
USER ```
USER 
USER Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
USER The REPLACE lines are already in src/components/InventoryItem.tsx!
USER 
USER The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc
USER 
USER # The other 1 SEARCH/REPLACE block were applied successfully.
USER Don't re-send them.
USER Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.
USER 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT Looking at the code, I see that the InventoryItem component already has the correct implementation with `removeItem(item.id, item.obtainedAt)`. Let me check the store implementation instead:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT src/lib/store.ts
ASSISTANT ```typescript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       removeItem: (itemId: string, obtainedAt: string) =>
ASSISTANT         set((state) => ({
ASSISTANT           inventory: state.inventory.filter((item) => 
ASSISTANT             !(item.id === itemId && item.obtainedAt === obtainedAt)
ASSISTANT           ),
ASSISTANT         })),
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I see that the store also already has the correct implementation. The issue must be somewhere else. Could you please show me the contents of the store's type definition file (src/types/game.ts) to verify the type signature matches the implementation?
